# Writing Good Docs

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

*Codeblocks* are super helpful to **copy, paste, and share** code.

A good CE uses codeblocks whenever possible, becasue it allows other to use their code to replicate issues.

- It is important **not** to use single quote marks
- Use backticks to create a code block - for example;


```
def my_code():
    x = 5 # same block
    x = x + 4 # same block
    print (x) # same block

my_code() # Not on the same block of code as above
```

- Try to apply syntax highlighting on codeblocks when possible, by adding in language name after the opening backticks

``` python
def my_code():
    x = 5 # same block
    x = x + 4 # same block
    print (x) # same block

my_code() # Not on the same block of code as above
```

- You can also use the right-pointing arrow to be a quote:
  >This is a quote.



## Adding Images

Easy enough to do
use `![name of file/alt text](link)`

This can be achieved by dragging and dropping the image too

## Making Task Lists
GFM extends capabilities to be able to add a checkable task list.
Use square braces with a space in the middle, add an x in the box when the task is complete
